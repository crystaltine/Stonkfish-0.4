# Stonkfish-4.0

== Update Oct 2, 2022 22:42 PDT ==
Swing/Mid-term trading bot trading SPY (for now) and (hopefully will) include both machine learning and conventional decision-making branches.

Goals for operational version: Have a neural network(s) that predict data using machine learning, and build a trend-identification module using regular algorithms and techniques to assist in this decision making. Other modules should also be able to use technical indicators to influence an overall market evaluation SPY evaluation is currently based on daily change, but later this should be shifted to account for overall trend, and will be dynamic and set by future modules.

Inception: August 27th, 2022 (something idk)

note: this bot sucks and i suck at coding. It will not be profitable or even work for a LONG time.

Notes:
Downtrend technicals are much more defined than those in bull markets when price is near all-time-highs. The lack of resistance levels means it is harder to set upside price targets to guide exit points. One solution for this is to just hold through a verified uptrend, with occasional small exits from RSI/BB-derived overbought conditions.
