this is a list of todos for a complete stonkfish prediction engine

- try to fix the LSTM (from version 3.1) to not return constant values for percent changes, if it continues breaking then switch to ANN (maybe)

- need more modules than just LSTMs and ML stuff, add regular code that checks indicators etc
    > restructure # of prediction days to be dynamic, which could tie into a potential trend indentification module

/ restructure percent_chg_data = pd.read_csv("DJI45YearData.csv") to pass in close prices [4], RSI, BB DJI45YearData

- get the code to accept more data (probably like 4 rows [%chg, bbtop, bbbottom, rsi] instead of just close price)
